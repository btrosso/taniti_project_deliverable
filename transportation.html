          Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, landing at the island's
          small but efficient airport. This airport currently accommodates small
          jets and propeller planes, providing frequent connections to nearby
          major cities. Efforts to expand the airport are underway, aiming to
          allow larger jets to land and thereby increase the island's capacity
          for international travelers. This expansion is expected to
          significantly boost tourism and the local economy. For those who
          prefer to travel by sea, a small cruise ship docks in Yellow Leaf Bay
          for one night per week, allowing passengers to enjoy a brief but
          immersive experience of Taniti's charm. These cruise visits add a
          unique flavor to the island's tourism profile, offering a blend of
          maritime adventure and cultural exploration.
