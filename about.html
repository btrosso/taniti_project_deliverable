        <h3>About the Island</h3>
        <p title="(About_the_island, n.d.)">
          Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island
          has an area of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and
          includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush
          tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a
          small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about
          20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy
          was dominated by fishing or agriculture.
